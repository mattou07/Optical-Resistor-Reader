# Optical-Resistor-Reader
A continuation of my university project into making a optical resistor reader
## Note:
This code is all experimental and the current implementation is not final.
## Dependancies
* OpenCV for Python [Link here](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_table_of_contents_setup/py_table_of_contents_setup.html#py-table-of-content-setup)
* Numpy
* PIL - Python Image Library
#
These are subjected to change as this is further developed
